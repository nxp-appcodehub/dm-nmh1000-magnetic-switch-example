Example Brief:
===================
This ISSDK FXLS8974CF example demonstrates SDCD configuration for tap-motion detection wake-up and enabling
auto-wake/sleep (AWS) feature to autonomously transition sensor to sleep mode on expiry of ASLP counter.

Hardware requirements
===================
- Mini/micro C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXN947 board
- Accel4 Click (https://www.mikroe.com/accel-4-click)
- Personal Computer

Board settings
============
Connect Accel4 (FXLS8974CF) MikroE click board to FRDM-MCXN947 MCU on MikroBUS header.

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
===============
Shake the board up and down 2-3 times to detect shake motion event.
When the demo runs successfully, you can see the Samples printed to the terminal.

 Successfully Applied FXLS8974 SDCD Configuration for Shake Detection

 ASLP (Auto Sleep) counter expired....
 Sensor Operating Mode Transitioned to Sleep Mode....SYSMODE = 2
 Putting MCU in low power sleep

 Shake Motion Detected by Sensor SDCD Block....
 Sensor Operating Mode Transitioned to Wake Mode....SYSMODE = 1
 MCU Woke-up on Tap Motion Event
 Will enter sleep mode after expiration of ASLP counter = ~5sec

 ASLP (Auto Sleep) counter expired....
 Sensor Operating Mode Transitioned to Sleep Mode....SYSMODE = 2
